# Feather Wiki example Caddyfile for Caddy 2
#---
# This configuration expects Feather Wiki to be named 'index.html'
# and should be a server version (https://codeberg.org/Alamantus/FeatherWiki#server-saving).
# As the webdav directive is not built-in, select it when
# downloading your caddy binary from
# https://caddyserver.com/download?package=github.com%2Fmholt%2Fcaddy-webdav
# or use
# `xcaddy --with github.com/mholt/caddy-webdav`
#---
# Change this to the domain where FeatherWiki is uploaded
# NOTE: Since saving is protected via basicauth, ensure
# HTTPS is used when accessing your wiki
# if 'http://' isn't specified, Caddy redirects to HTTPS by default.
# You *can* set this to localhost to run locally.
