# FeatherWiki example Caddyfile for Caddy 2

# This configuration expects FeatherWiki to be named 'index.html'
# As the webdav directive is not built-in, select it when
# downloading your caddy binary, or use
# 'xcaddy --with github.com/mholt/caddy-webdav'
#---
# change this to the domain where FeatherWiki is uploaded
# NOTE: Since saving is protected via basicauth, ensure
#  HTTPS is used when accessing your wiki
# if 'http://' isn't specified, Caddy redirects to HTTPS by default.
