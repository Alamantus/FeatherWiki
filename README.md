# featherwiki

The idea is that it's like [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) but as small as possible.

## To Do

- Display parent pages in sidebar
  - tabbed interface for pages/tags
- Add sorting to sidebar (? Alphabetical may be sufficient)
- Allow adding image from gallery
- Allow setting a home page from settings
- Allow deleting a page
