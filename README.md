# Feather Wiki

A lightweight quine for simple wikis! The idea is that it's like [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) but as small as possible.

Check out the [Documentation](https://alamantus.github.com/FeatherWiki/) to see it in action and learn how to use it!

## Possible Ideas

- Custom CSS field
- Add sorting to sidebar (? Alphabetical may be sufficient)
- Allow adding/editing image alt text(?)
