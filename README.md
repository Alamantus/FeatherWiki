# Feather Wiki

A lightweight quine for simple wikis! The idea is that it's like [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) but as small as possible.

Check out the [Documentation](https://alamantus.codeberg.page/FeatherWiki/) to see it in action and learn how to use it!

## Supported Browsers

🤖 Technical Talk 👨‍💻 Feather Wiki uses various JavaScript features that are as new as having been added to the ECMAScript specification
as recently as 2018. According to [this ECMAScript compatibility table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/), the following
browser versions should definitely be able to run Feather Wiki without issues:

- Chrome 86+
- Edge 87+
- Firefox 88+
- iOS Safari 12+
- Opera 73+
- Opera Mobile 62+
- Safari 13+
- Samsung Internet for Android 12+

If your browser is older than any of these, you _might_ still be able to run Feather Wiki, but you'll have to check yourself if it
supports features from ECMAScript 2018. 💻

## Possible Ideas

- Custom CSS field
- Add sorting to sidebar (? Alphabetical may be sufficient)
- Allow adding/editing image alt text(?)
