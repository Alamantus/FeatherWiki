Title &amp; Description</h2><p>Your Wiki Title and Wiki Description appear on the top left side of your wiki. A title is required for your wiki, and clicking it will take you to your wiki's home page. A description is optional, and if the Wiki Description field is left blank, it will simply not display.</p><h2>2. Home Page</h2><p>Once you [[Create a Page]] in your wiki, you can choose that page to be the first thing that loads when visiting your wiki. By default, the home page will display all of your wiki's pages with parent and child pages nested appropriately, but you can specify <i>any</i>&nbsp;page of your wiki to be the home page, even if it is a child of another page.</p><h2>3. Custom CSS</h2><p>If you're savvy with your browser's inspector, want to change how your wiki looks, the Custom CSS field lets you enter <i>any</i>&nbsp;CSS you want! There's not a lot more to say here, just make sure that your CSS is valid and that you don't put any HTML in this field or else you'll mess things up for yourself. Also be aware that your custom CSS will <i>not</i> be minified and may make your resulting wiki slightly larger as a result.</p><h2>4. Publishing</h2><p>Checking the \"Publish\" box will hide all of the buttons that enable modifying your wiki. This includes the \"Wiki Settings\" link, the \"New Page\" button, the \"Edit\" buttons on wiki pages, and the \"Save Wiki\" button. When this box is checked and you click the \"Update\" button, the specified buttons will <i>only</i>&nbsp;be visible on the Wiki Settings page, which can still be visited manually by adding <a internal=\"\" href=\"?page=s\">?page=s</a> after the <code>.html</code> part of your URL. (Clicking that link will take you to the Wiki Settings page for <i>this</i> wiki!)</p><p>View [[Publishing]] for some tips on how to make your Feather Wiki public.</p><h2>5. Import &amp; Overwrite (Upgrading)</h2><p>This button is intended to be used to upgrade a Feather Wiki that was created using an older version to a new version. It accomplishes this by loading an old Feather Wiki's HTML file, grabbing the data, and overwriting the current session with that old data. Once loaded, you can click the \"Save Wiki\" button to save your old data in the new version of Feather Wiki!</p><p>Be aware that this is instantaneous once loaded, but it will only overwrite your existing data if you specifically choose to save the download in a way that overwrites the old file.</p><h2>6. Manage Inserted Images</h2><p>If you choose the option to insert an image from a file (the 📸 icon in the [[page editor|create_a_page]]), Feather Wiki will store that image as data in your HTML file in a way that makes it re-usable. You can view the images you have added this way from the \"Existing Images\" section of the Wiki Settings page. This section allows you to view the full-size image, delete the image, or see what pages the image is used in. If you choose to delete the image, it will also remove the image from all pages it is used in, if any, so please be cautious with this action. Note, however, that your image will not truly be lost unless you choose to overwrite the original Feather Wiki HTML file with the newly saved version.</p>","G":1652475290754,"H":"=Ze1C|R0&"},{"C":"|gosAhD!C","A":"Create A Page","D":"create_a_page","E":1652374565701,"F":"<p>Creating a page is as simple as clicking the \"New Page\" button in the menu, setting a title in the text box that appears, and clicking \"Create!\" Once you create a page, it will be visible in the All Pages list and the menu as a quick link item. You can remove a page from the menu by setting its Parent field to another page. You can also Edit an existing page by visiting that page and clicking the \"Edit\" button next to the modified date.</p><p>Creating and editing pages both have the same options:</p><ol><li><a internal href=\"#title\">Title &amp; Slug</a></li><li><a internal href=\"#content\">Page Content</a><ul><li><a internal href=\"#links\">Adding Links</a></li><li><a internal href=\"#images\">Adding Images</a></li></ul></li><li><a internal href=\"#tags\">Tags</a></li><li><a internal href=\"#nesting\">Nesting</a></li><li><a internal href=\"#saving\">Saving &amp; Deleting</a></li></ol><h2 id=\"title\">Title &amp; Slug</h2><p>While a title is fairly self-explanatory, the Page Slug is the identifier that is used to display the page. Feather Wiki will generate a Page Slug by lower-casing your page's title and replacing all spaces with underscores (<code>_</code>) and non-letter characters with dashes (<code>-</code>). If you change your Page Slug to something else, this same replacement process will happen when you save your page, or you can optionally click the \"Slugify Title\" button to create a slug from the title.</p><p>Slugs must be unique across your whole Feather Wiki, and they must be at least 2 characters long (single-character slugs are reserved for Feather Wiki's internal pages).</p><aside><p>For example, while you can have multiple pages titled \"About,\" you must specify a different slug for each page. When you create a new page using the button in the menu, the generated slug will check for existing slugs and append an incrementing number to the end of the slug if it finds a duplicate. So after you create your first About page, its slug will be set to \"about,\" but when you create your second \"About\" page, its slug will be set to \"about_1\", and so forth. Keep in mind that this automatic incrementation has an interesting consequence in this situation: if you were to then create a page titled \"About 1\", the resulting slug would see that \"about_1\" already exists and then automatically generate \"about_2\".</p><p>Either way, you can always set a different slug afterward!</p></aside><h2 id=\"content\">Page Content</h2><p>The large box below the title and slug is a rich text editor where you can enter the content for your page. Along the top is a toolbar with various common formatting options—hovering over each will display what they do. By default, content you type is surrounded by the HTML <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, and each time you press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd> on your keyboard it starts a new paragraph with that content starting a new <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> block. If you know what you're doing, you can click the \"Show HTML\" button below the editor to display and edit the HTML of the content you have entered in the editor and toggle it back to the editor when you are done!</p><h3 id=\"links\">Adding Links</h3><p>There are 2 different types of links as far as Feather Wiki is concerned: internal and external links.</p><p>As the name implies, <i>External</i> links go to web pages outside of your Feather Wiki. You can insert external links into your page content using the 🔗 icon in the toolbar. This will either insert the link you specify in full where the editor's cursor is displayed, or it will make any highlighted text a clickable link to the URL you specified. External links are identified with a <code>⧉</code> icon and will open in a new tab.</p><p><i>Internal</i>&nbsp;links are links that go to other pages within your Feather Wiki. You can create an internal link by wrapping any text in two brackets [‍‍[like this]‍‍]. The text inside the brackets will be \"slugified\" as mentioned above and generate a link to that page. You can also manually specify a slug to link to with different text linking to it by putting the slug after a vertical bar [‍‍[like this|page_slug]‍‍].</p><p>If you create an internal link to a page that does not yet exist, it will be indicated as nonexistent by being colored red with a little exclamation point [[like this]]. But if you visit a nonexistent page, Feather Wiki will give you the opportunity to <i>create</i>&nbsp;that page, which can be useful for preparing pages you want to write later.</p><h3 id=\"images\">Adding Images</h3><p>Just like with links, Feather Wiki separates images into two types: internal and external.</p><p><i>External</i> images are stored elsewhere on the internet and are referenced by their URLs in your Feather Wiki. You can insert external images using the 🖼️ icon in the toolbar. When you specify an external image's URL, it will insert it into the editor where your cursor is, usually as a new paragraph. Using external images can help keep the file size of your Feather Wiki small, but it will require an internet connection to view the image when you load your Feather Wiki.</p><p><i>Internal</i> images are files you upload from your computer that get stored directly inside of your Feather Wiki's HTML file. You can insert internal images using the 📸 icon in the toolbar. Because Feather Wiki aims to stay small, your image will be automatically scaled down to either a width of 400 pixels or a height of 350 pixels, depending on whether the image is portrait or landscape (a future update may allow you to customize this, but these values are hard-coded for now). If the image's dimensions are already smaller than 400x350 pixels, then it will not be scaled.</p><p>If you have already added internal images to your Feather Wiki, you can use the 📎 icon in the toolbar to insert one of those existing images into your page. Click the 👁 button to view the full size image in a new tab or the ✅ button to insert it into your page. Feather Wiki handles internal images in a way that saves file size, so if you add multiples of the same image, your Feather Wiki will only grow in file size by the size of the single image you inserted instead of duplicating the image data stored inside your HTML file.</p><aside><p>After inserting an image, you can cut and paste it into a different spot if you need to, and it should work without issues, but be aware that there can sometimes be some oddities when doing this. Knowing how to edit HTML can help if any oddities arise, but be aware that editing the HTML of a page that is using an <i>internal</i> image can be troublesome because the entirety of the image's data is displayed in the HTML and may make it hard to read.</p></aside><h2 id=\"tags\">Tags</h2><p>You can add arbitrary tags to any page in order to help categorize or otherwise identify them. The \"Page Tags\" field requires a comma, separated, list of text that will be identified as tags. When you add tags to any page, those tags will appear as a tab in the menu. From the \"Tags\" tab in the menu, you can view all pages that are tagged with any of the tags specified in the list. Removing a tag from the page and saving the page will remove the page from that tag list. If there are <i>no</i>&nbsp;pages that are using a tag, then the tag will be removed from the Tags list, and if none of your pages have any tags, then the Tags tab will not display in the menu.</p><p>Be aware that tags width Different, capitaliZations are identified as separate tags. You can use the \"Add Existing Tag\" drop-down box to choose a tag that you have already added to another page to make sure you get the spelling and capitalization correct.</p><h2 id=\"parent\">Nesting</h2><p>Feather Wiki includes the ability to nest pages below other pages to help with organization. The \"Parent\" drop-down box shows all pages currently on the wiki aside from the current page with the page's title and slug. If your page's Parent field is set to \"None,\" then it will display in the Pages list in the menu. Choosing a page to be the current page's parent will not only remove it from the menu's Pages list and show a breadcrumb link above the page title, but it will cause it to display as a nested item underneath that parent page in the All Pages list as well as in a \"Sub Pages\" list on the parent page itself. Check the [[Learn]] page on this wiki for an example of how this looks!</p><h2 id=\"saving\">Saving &amp; Deleting</h2><p>If you've used computer programs before, this should be fairly unsurprising: when you're done editing your page, clicking the \"Save\" button will finalize your changes and display the result.</p><p>The small, red \"Delete\" button below the \"Save\" button on the edit screen of a page will ask for confirmation before removing the page from your wiki. If the page you delete is the parent of another page, then any child page will have its \"Parent\" value set back to \"None\" to avoid issues with nonexistent pages.</p><p>After saving changes or deleting a page, the \"Save Wiki\" button should be highlighted in red and the message \"Wiki has changed!\" should display above it to remind you to save your wiki to make your changes permanent.</p>","G":1652474737290,"H":"=Ze1C|R0&"},{"C":"1N4)@g.MO","A":"Navigating","D":"navigating","E":1652388778608,"F":"<p>Feather Wiki is fairly simple, but this page will explain all the different ways of getting around.</p><ul><li>Clicking the title of your wiki (in the top left corner of the screen) will take you to your [[home page|wiki_settings]].</li><li>Clicking the [[Wiki Settings]] button will take you to the <a internal=\"\" href=\"?page=s\">Wiki Settings page</a>.</li><li>Clicking the \"New Page\" button will show a field to enter the title of a new page for Feather Wiki to create.</li><li>The \"Pages\" tab button (selected by default on load) will list all of the pages that do not have parents set.</li><li>The \"All Pages\" link under the Pages tab will take you to a page that lists all of your pages with a visual indication of how your pages are nested.</li><li>The \"Tags\" tab button (only visible if at least one page has at least one tag) will list all of the tags used by any page in the wiki.</li><li>Clicking a tag from the Tags tab will display a list of all of the pages that have that tag.</li><li>The \"Recent\" tab button keeps track of the pages you have visited this session in the order of most to least recent.</li><li>Visiting a page slug that doesn't exist will display a page edit interface that allows you to create the nonexistent slug as a new page.</li><li>Clicking the \"Edit\" button from a page will show that page's edit screen where you can modify that page.</li></ul>","H":"=Ze1C|R0&","G":1652389571446},{"C":"n)w>}e7It","A":"FAQs & Tips","D":"faqs","E":1652331531133,"F":"<dl><dt>Why can't my friend load my Feather Wiki?</dt><dd>The main reason someone might not be able to load your wiki is because their web browser might not support some of the JavaScript features used by Feather Wiki.
